The Hollowing – A Descent Into Madness

About the Mod

The Hollowing is a psychological survival horror mod for Minecraft that introduces a Sanity System, making darkness a true threat. As night falls or shadows consume your surroundings, your sanity begins to decay, leading to hallucinations, eerie whispers, and the risk of losing yourself to madness. If you let your sanity drop too low, reality itself may break apart—or worse, you may never wake up.

🌑 Sanity Mechanic – Darkness eats away at your mind, causing terrifying effects.

👁 Distorted Reality – Phantom mobs, strange sounds, and shifting perceptions await.

🧟 Enhanced Mobs – Zombies and other creatures are deadlier and more relentless.

🩸 Injury System – Broken bones and bleeding add to the survival challenge.

🍯 Sanity Restoration – Regain sanity with Golden Apples, Honey Bottles, and the special Sanity Potion.
