The Hollowing – A Descent Into Madness

About the Mod

The Hollowing is a psychological survival horror mod for Minecraft that introduces a Sanity System, making darkness a true threat. As night falls or shadows consume your surroundings, your sanity begins to decay, leading to hallucinations, eerie whispers, and the risk of losing yourself to madness.

👁 Distorted Reality – Phantom mobs, strange sounds, and shifting perceptions await.

🧟 Enhanced Mobs – Zombies and other creatures are deadlier and more relentless.
