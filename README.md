# SanityModMC
Darkness is no longer just an absence of light—it’s a force that erodes your mind.

The Hollowing mod introduces a sanity system that makes survival in Minecraft a psychological challenge. As night falls or you linger in the shadows, your sanity begins to decay, warping your perception and summoning hallucinations. If you let it drop too low, reality itself might break… or worse, you might never wake up.

Features:
🌑 Sanity Mechanic – Stay in the dark too long, and your sanity crumbles, leading to hallucinations, eerie whispers, and even death.
👁 Distorted Reality – See phantom mobs and hear disturbing sounds as you teeter on the edge of madness.
🧟 Enhanced Mobs – Zombies are stronger, more relentless, and will hunt you down with new vigor.
🩸 Injury System – Severe damage can cause broken bones and bleeding, making survival even deadlier.
🕰 Extended Nights – The darkness lingers longer than usual, forcing you to confront your fears.
🍯 Sanity Restoration – Recover your mind with Golden Apples, Honey Bottles, and the special Sanity Potion (crafted with a Glass Bottle, Golden Apple, and Golden Carrot).
